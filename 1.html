A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency" target="_blank" title="coin">cryptocurrency</a>
(or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions,
to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.
[1][2][3] Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currencies, alternative currencies and virtual currencies. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control
[4] as opposed to centralized electronic money and central banking systems.
[5] The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through a blockchain, which is a public transaction database, functioning as a distributed ledger.
